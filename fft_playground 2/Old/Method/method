We first present subjects with a clip of transformed audio and ask them to write down any words they recognize or the entire phrase if they recognize it. We allow them to listen to the audio twice. After this we show them the content of the clip in text form. We repeat this process with 2 more phrases, however we do not tell participants the correct interpretation of the audio.
We then divide our subjects into a training group and a non training group. The training group receives 3 minutes of transformed audio and the text of the audio so that they can follow what they are listening to and potentially learn how the transformed audio works. The non training group receives nothing.
We then have a followup session with each subject after one day where we present them with the original three phrases and 3 new ones. We again record how well they perform.
